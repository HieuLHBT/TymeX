Currency conversion application.

- Application structure:
The application interface design is relatively similar to a handheld calculator, including 1 main screen and 1 sub-screen.
The main screen includes numeric keys, operator function keys, delete and a screen displaying the converted currency. There are 2 function keys to convert exchange rates (currently only applicable to EUR exchange rates due to API permission limitations).
The sub-screen has the function of displaying, searching and selecting the conversion rate.

- Construction steps:
Design the display interface of the input value and the conversion value. Design the number input keys, function keys: operator, delete, change exchange rate.
Design the interface to display the list of currency exchange rates. Design the search box.
Map the application elements. Build functional code and process data.
Build the API reading tool and convert data.
Build and complete other functions of the application: calculation, conversion, search, ...
Run the demo application and test on the test device.
Evaluate the function, edit, change until the application runs completely.

- Note:
Check the connection, check the data of the API from the supplier. Read the documentation and apply the provided API, handle and prevent unexpected errors.
Design, format the data displayed after being calculated and converted.
